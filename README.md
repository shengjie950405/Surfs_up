- The min temperature between Dec and June is one of the key difference, which indicate that the weather risk in Dec will be higher than Jun which the temp of Dec reach to the minimum amount.
- The average of temp between Dec and Jun is the second difference, the average temp of Dec is lower than Jun and it may cause more issue for Surf business with relative low average of temperature.
- The thrid difference is the majority of temp between Jun and Dec, majority of weather at June is above 73.00 and it's a suitable weather for surfing and ice-cream business.

   
## Summary

- We could visualize the temp data by "df.plot" queries to see the trend of temperature of each month
- We could sort the index of the date to see the change of temperature by ascending date df = df.sort_index().
